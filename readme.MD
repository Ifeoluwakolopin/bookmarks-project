----------------------------
## My First Web Project.

Working on this to help me learn Dango. 
I'm also learning about git and github and the workflow!
*Project might be full of bugs. (most likely. :-) ).*

# Daily Tasks

-  Read and Code
-  Push my commits to GitHub
-  Have a good night rest
    
Guess the uncompleted task :wink:
Yup! I don't really sleep at night. :yawn:
