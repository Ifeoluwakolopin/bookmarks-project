## My First Web Project.
---------------------------------
Working on this to help me learn Dango.<br>
I'm also learning about git and github and the workflow!<br>
*Project might be full of bugs. (most definitely. :dizzy_face: ).*

# Daily Tasks

-  Read and Code
-  Push my commits to GitHub
-  Have a good night rest
    
Guess the uncompleted task :wink:
Yup! I don't really sleep at night. :sleepy:
